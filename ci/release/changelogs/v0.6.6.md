#### Features üöÄ

- Glob inverse filters are implemented (e.g. `*: {!&shape: circle; style.fill: red}` to turn all non-circles red) [#2008](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2008)
- Globs can be used in glob filter values, including checking for existence (e.g. `*: {&link: *; style.fill: red}` to turn all objects with a link red) [#2009](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2009)

#### Improvements üßπ

- Opacity 0 shapes no longer have a label mask which made any segment of connections going through them lower opacity [#1940](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1940)
- Bidirectional connections are now animated in opposite directions rather than one direction [#1939](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1939)
