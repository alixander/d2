#### Features üöÄ

- `style.underline` works on connections [#1836](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1836)
- `none` is added as an accepted value for `fill-pattern`. Previously there was no way to cancel the `fill-pattern` on select objects set by a theme that applies it (Origami) [#1882](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1882)

#### Improvements üßπ

- Dimensions can be set less than label dimensions [#1901](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1901)
- Boards no longer inherit `label` fields from parents [#1838](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1838)
- Prevents `near` targeting a child of a special object like grid cells, which wasn't doing anything [#1851](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1851)

- Fixes `null` being set on a nested shape not working in certain cases when connections also pointed to that shape [#1830](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1830)
- Fixes edge case of bad import syntax crashing using d2 as a library [#1829](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1829)
